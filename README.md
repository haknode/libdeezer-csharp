# libdeezer-sharp

DZNativeCSharp shows how the [DEEZER Native SDK](http://developers.deezer.com/sdk/native) can be used with .NET/C#.

## Notes
 - The UnityPlayer sample from Deezer [deezer/native-sdk-samples/UnityPlayer](https://github.com/deezer/native-sdk-samples/tree/master/UnityPlayer) is used as base.
 - The example code was only changed slightly.
 - Not all methods from the native SDK are exposed yet.
 - The project intentionally uses .NET version 3.5.
 - The project intentionally is only set up for x64.
